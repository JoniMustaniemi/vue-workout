# Vue Workout

## Overview
**Vue Workout** is a modern web application built with [**Vue.js 3**](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend and [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend, both hosted separately. The project is designed for scalability, maintainability, and cross-platform support. It can be used either in a web browser or as a mobile app. It integrates with [**Azure Cosmos DB**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) for efficient cloud-based data storage and includes mobile app development support through [**Capacitor**](https://capacitorjs.com/).

## Features
- **Frontend**:  
  Built using [**Vue.js 3**](https://vuejs.org/) for dynamic, reactive interfaces, with navigation handled by [**Vue Router**](https://router.vuejs.org/). The frontend is styled with [**Quasar**](https://quasar.dev/) and [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/), providing a modern, responsive design. Development is optimized with [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast, efficient workflows.

- **Backend**:  
  The server-side logic is managed by [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/), providing RESTful APIs and integration with [**Azure Cosmos DB**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) for cloud-based, scalable data storage. Middleware like [**CORS**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) and [**Dotenv**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) are used for secure configurations.

- **Mobile Support**:  
  Mobile app support is enabled through [**Capacitor**](https://capacitorjs.com/), allowing the app to be deployed on both Android and iOS platforms.
